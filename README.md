1. JSON.parse()  ... to JavaScript object
const obj = JSON.parse('{"name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}');

2. Response.json()
The json() method of the Response interface takes a Response stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise which resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON.

Note that despite the method being named json(), the result is not JSON but is instead the result of taking JSON as input and parsing it to produce a JavaScript object

3. The JSON.stringify() method converts a JavaScript object or value to a JSON string
